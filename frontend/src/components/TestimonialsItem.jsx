I have be on and off of several fitness programs for the last couple of decades and I can never keep motivated enough to stick with anything.  I’ve tried about every fitness concept and approach that has been hyped but I’ve always lost interest, and even gotten bored with a few of them. They all feel so depersonalized (if that’s a word).",

      longText: "Even though at my age it’s become more important than ever for me to get my health and fitness on track, I am extremely skeptical of anything I see or hear about.  I thought why should Kolasko’s program be any different?  Sometimes I think that these fitness deals are just something that these fitness centres come up with, take your money and don’t really care if you keep coming or not.  I think that’s how they make their money.  Get people excited, sign them up, debit their account and move on to the next. But Kolasko’s Life Center has totally changed my perspective!  I wasn’t just herded like cattle or treated like just another number.  Andrew painstakingly took the time to find out what mattered to me and what motivated and drove me.  From the initial consultation, where he found out everything that he possibly could about me.  He made me think about stuff that I hadn’t even thought of.  But it was stuff that really mattered.  He challenged me and forced me to dig deep about what it was important to me, and what it meant to me to be active, healthy, have energy and want to look good in my board shorts! Lol! Once he knew the foundation for why I get up in the morning and do what I do, and for who I do it for, he used that that to constantly motivate me.  It also reminds me why I put in the effort and time and focus. I now know why I wasn’t motivated by all these other fitness programs.  They always felt so cookie cutter and Life Center’s approach was totally customized specifically for me.  I have some specific health challenges that were addressed, as well certain foods that I can’t eat.  And what was really cool is Andrew put together a fitness program that has me doing the activities that I enjoy, and he changes it up to keep it interesting for me.  Although he is still using a plan that needs to be followed it doesn’t feel like a routine.  I think other places I have been have focused on the masses and have never been personalized.  What Andrew does is a lot more involved, and that would definitely take more time on his part, but for me it makes all the difference. We set out my goals and objectives on the outset and everything is done with an eye towards that.  Now I feel motivated everyday to do the workouts, the bio-hacks, hormesis methodologies, follow the diet, eat at specific times, etc. Andrew follows up with me, tracks my progress and together we look at the results and he evolves my program as we go along. If you’re looking for a fitness program, and quite frankly, a way of life, that is tailored specifically for you then I highly recommend working with Andrew.  In know its strong words, but this 67 program has been transformative!  It’s carefully planned out from the beginning, its methodical, engaging, motivating, progressive and fulfilling.  I truly feel a sense of achievement and satisfaction! And bottomline, he cares about me as a person.  And that makes all the difference!  I did need the personal care and extra attention when it came to this area of my life.  I wholeheartedly recommend Andrew Kolasko Life Center and its programs if you want to feel younger, have more energy, look better and get in the best shape of your life."

      longText: "I’ve tried a lot of diets and exercise programs and haven’t had a lot of success.  There’s been a lot of quick fix health and fitness things that I have tried and none of them have made any lasting results.  Although the marketing of Andrew Kolasko Life Center resonated with me I was skeptical as to why this would be any different.  The main things that got my interest is that he was actually similar to the same age as me and his approach sounded more holistic, and he had a longevity focus. But still, shelling out a bunch of money and wasting my valuable time was a concern.  And I was starting to give up on anything working for me.  I didn’t want to get my hopes up and then be let down.  If I’m going to commit to something I actually want to see results. Now that I’ve had the training, guidance and motivation provided through the 67 program I can say that I am very pleased.  I was impressed by how well thought out the program was.  Right from the beginning process of the intake form, to Andrew asking more and more questions to get solid understanding of where I had been in my fitness and health, all the way back to what athletics I liked way back in high school, to nutrition, to where I want to be at age 60, 70 and 80.  He does what he calls backcasting from where you want to be in the future to where you need to be now, as opposed to just forecasting… interesting process and line of thinking….  And it works.  It works because it’s based on research.  And not just the research that he knows applies, but to the background research he did on me as a client.  I really have a plan and a focus and reason for what I do every day/week (in my health and fitness) and that makes all the difference. Up until working with Andrew all I was ever given was come generic workout plan some generic nutrition guide to follow.  Andrew’s Life Center came up with a fitness blueprint that evolved week to week and it was based on what I liked to do.  There were some things that I wasn’t doing but Andrew tried to incorporate my preferences as much as possible for the fitness portion.  So I’m doing what I want to do and that’s motivating in and of itself.  The structure of the meal planning and eating window was also customized as much as it could be to what I enjoyed, once again I had to add some new foods to get more of a balance.  Finally Andrew really got to know me and what motivates me… using what he called my very own “motivational sandwiches” to encourage me to do my fitness plan and stay on track.  These would remind me of what matters most. I.E. My wife, grand kids, increased energy and better sleep. What is remarkable is that this is much more than a simple health and fitness program.  It really encompasses you as a whole person.  Like Andrew says “it’s all connected.”  His line of questioning also fosters introspection so that you become more aware of your own patterns of thought and behavior.  So this is more about about an overall way of life and approach to your day, and in a way that matters to each specific individual.  What Andrew has me doing aligns with who I am and therefore makes sense to me and gives that rationality behind why I’m doing this workout, why it’s the length that it is, why I’m eating this way, why I’m doing my ice bath and hot sauna, why I’m doing breath work and meditation.  I’m now excited about my future health for the first time in I don’t know how long! If you’re someone that wants a health and fitness blueprint that is customized to you, specific to you and your needs and what motivates you, then I highly recommend the 67 program by Andrew Kolasko Life Center.  You’re not going to find a program that is more tailored to who you are, where you are in your health journey, and that takes into account your own personal motivation and what drives you.  Everything Andrew does with his 67 program has a reason and that reason is the individual success of each and everyone of his clients."

      longText: " Honestly, investing $5,000 on an online fitness/health campaign, even though there is the longevity component, which is worth noting, it would still take quite a financial commitment.  I make good money but it is still a significant amount of money for any online course and I wasn’t sure that it was going to be worth it.  I was concerned it wasn’t going to make much of a difference in my health and fitness. Before deciding to enrol, honestly, I was on the fence, because I’ve enrolled in weight loss and fitness programs that have promised the moon and failed to deliver.  And I was afraid that this program was no different. So before signing up, my biggest hesitation, honestly, was cost.  This program is a healthy amount of money for someone even on my income.  In fact, I had a long conversation with my wife about whether or not I should spring for it.  Honestly, I was worried it wasn’t going to be worth it and I’d have to tell my wife that I made a stupid purchase. Dam!  I had no idea what I’d do without the 67 program!  I couldn’t believe how transformational it was.  Every question I had was answered every step of the way. The program was customized specifically for the fitness level I was at.  Firstly Andrew got to know me, very well.  He knew how to motivate me and help me set measurable goals to make steady progress.  I was able to get to everything I needed along the way on Andrew’s unique app.  I can’t believe that he had an app!  I’ve never seen anything like it!  And certainly not in the health industry! Bottomline, I felt supported by Andrew and I have never done a program so carefully crafted for me and where I am at in my life!  This course is one of the best investments I’ve ever made! I didn’t have a serious health/fitness program prior to the 67 program, and most importantly, I had never given much thought to my longevity.  Because frankly, I’ve been more and more scared about my state of health in the future, as I’ve started to see my steady decline and the decline of my friends.  But what’s exciting about Andrew’s program is it is setting me up for my long-term health, not just the here and now.  Andrew has helped me plan on where my health and fitness needs to be at age 60, 65, 70 and so on.  This is far beyond the other fitness programs I have tried that only worry about the next 3 months or maybe a year.  He looks past the short-term and really cares about me having a healthy, happier life in the long-term! I have greater clarity and confidence about what I need to do and the drive behind it to meet it week in and week out.  My wife has seen the difference in me and how much happier and fulfilled that I have felt since starting the 67 program and signing on for a full year with Andrew’s Life Center and getting the one-to-one consultation weekly/monthly. If you’re thinking about joining the 67 Program but you’re on the fence right now, here’s what I recommend… jump in. Seriuosly.  I know this program is only offered a few times a year.  I wish I had met started working with Andrew Kolasko Life Center 10 years ago!  Because I’ve made more progress in the last 2 months than I have since my 20s.  This was a some big coin for me and $5,000 was a big commitment, but the material, the support, the motivation, customization and the results are worth 10 times that much! Because at this age of my life all I’ve got that matters is my health and my loved ones.  And I can’t enjoy my family for as long as I want if I don’t concentrate on my health!!  I could go on and on about the positivity that Andrew has and his kindness and care and commitment, you feel like he’s shoulder to shoulder with you through the whole process!  His approach is what I needed for me to be able to stick with it and make it a lifestyle."
